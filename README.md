# About the Workshop
Amrita Center for Wireless Networks & Applications (AmritaWNA), Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham and its partners will host a Workshop on Technology Enabler for Smart Cities (TESC-2019) co-located with the BuildSys 2019 : 6th ACM International Conference on Systems for Energy-Efficient Buildings, Cities, and Transportation scheduled to be held from November 13 - 14, 2019 at Columbia University, New York.

By 2050, it is envisaged that more than half of the worldwide population will live in urban areas. Owing to this trend, solutions and policies need to set forth in order to manage resource consumption, wastage and overall costs in urban spaces. Smart Cities offer huge potential to revolutionize a range of utilities and services in urban spaces including areas such as healthcare, energy management, transportation, security and smart buildings. Smart city integrates the modern digital technologies such as sensing, IoT, networking, cloud computing, big data, machine learning and artificial intelligence to ensure economic and environmental sustainability. The goal of the workshop, Technology Enabler for Smart Cities (TESC-2019), is to provide a forum where diverse group of researchers can share the latest research insights, present key and novel results on both theoretical and application perspectives of smart cities.
